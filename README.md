# NanTienProject

The Nan Tien Temple would like to have a solution developed which provides them with a new way to:
- Further Promote Buddhism and Chinese culture.
- Publicize News and Events happening at the temple.
- Receive feedback and suggestions (otherwise known as reflections)
To solve this issue, it has been decided that our team will develop both a front end mobile application for Android devices and a back end management website with its own database.

The front end mobile application will display and notify users about current and past news and events. Allow for the submission of general feedback or suggestions from users and allow them to complete individual activities for up to 52 weeks with the purpose of educating them about Buddhism.

The back end management website will be used by IT staff at the Nan Tien Temple to manage the users, arrange the content of news and events appearing on the mobile application, view some simple statistics related to activities or events and manage the feedback given from the front end mobile application.
